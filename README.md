[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-projects.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-projects)

This plugin provides functionality to export the current contents of the Dradis repository into a package that can be downloaded and stored as a backup.

It also provides functionality to restore the state of Dradis from one of these packages.

This plugin will work with any database supported by Rails' ActiveResource data access layer.
